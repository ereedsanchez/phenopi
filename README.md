## PhenoPi

The current collection of scripts is rough around the edges and a work in progress.

In theory there would be 3 scripts to run. One overall script called install_phenopoi.sh and two others called by it, mainly install\_mjpeg\_daemon.sh and install\_rtc.sh.

The latter scripts installs the website interface and the real time clock (if available).

Currently the install\_mjpeg\_install.sh works but needs work on installing the startup parameters.

The overall script is still a mess.
